            I am a full Stack Engineer with an emphasis on creative technology. After working at an advertising startup that emphasized integrating creative with web applications, I decided to fully commit to being a Full-Stack Engineer by attending IronHack bootcamp in Lisbon Portugal.

As someone who studied creative media in college while also taking computer science courses, I’ve always had an interest software engineering. When my last job finally asked me to creatively apply JavaScript to advertisements, I knew now was the time to fully become a full stack engineer.

As a creative, I’ve always had to take on as many diverse tasks as possible, which is why Full-Stack engineering feels like the perfect fit. The fact that it combines both Front End and Back End technologies makes me feel right at home with my previous experience juggling creative design collaboratively and applying those designs to technologies for deployment. Personally for me, it is always important that I keep myself well rounded and in tune with both front and back end teams to continue to innovate on the technologies and projects. All I ask from companies that I work for is that they too attempt to keep pushing itself forward and creatively innovate.

My expertise includes Javascript, React, MongoDB, AXIOS, NodeJs, ExpressJs, ES6, HTML & CSS
